## Setup

### Vim

This is an export of my local [wiki.vim](https://github.com/lervag/wiki.vim) onto a public domain website. [Vim](https://vim.org) is a highly configurable text editor built to make creating and changing any kind of text very efficient. This allows me to type extremely fast and efficiently, which is why I chose it.

### Anki

[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net) is an intelligent flashcard system based on a proven studying technique known as [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition)

The way that anki flashcards are organized:

```
|- all.txt | all flashcards for all subjects
|- subject1
  |- all.txt | all flashcards for that subject
  |- example_page.md
  |- example_page.txt | all flashcards on that page

```

## Notes

### 9th Grade

- [English](english/English.md)
- [Math](math/Math.md)
- [Science](science/Science.md)

## Usage

Source code and raw markdown files are available on my [github](https://github.com/dragondmoney/wiki)

Anki cards are defined as such:
An ***italic and bolded*** text prefixed with ***$ <question>***
and a blockquote with the answer:
> this is a blockquote

### Examples:

***$ How does an example Anki card work?***
> You can indicate an italic text by prefixing it with $.
> And this text is also included :)

***$ What is this?***
> This is another test anki card

You can see these exported cards are at [index.txt](/index.txt)
