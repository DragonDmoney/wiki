# Academics and Notes

This is an export of my local wiki.vim onto a public domain website.

This notes system is a custom tool to include [anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) flashcards.

The way that anki flashcards are organized:

```
|- all.txt | all flashcards for all subjects
|- subject1
  |- all.txt | all flashcards for that subject
  |- example_page.md
  |- example_page.txt | all flashcards on that page

```

## 9th Grade

- [Math](math/Math.md)
- [Science](science/Science.md)

***$ How does an example Anki card work?***

***$ What is this?***
