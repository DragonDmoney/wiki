# Community Ecology

***$ What is a community?***
> A group of populations of different species living close enough to interact

***$ What are interspecific interactions?***
> Interspecific between two different species

***$ What are intraspecific interactions?***
> Interactions within the same species.

## Interactions

### Competition: (-,-)

Always a negative-negative interaction. Both species will be negatively impacted.

***$ What is a niche?***
> Ecological address of a specie. What you eat, habitat, what are your competitors, etc.

***$ What is the competitive exclusion principle?***
> Two species cannot coexist if they compete for the same resource, the one that competes best will overtake the other species.

***$ What is the resource partition principle?***
> When species co-exist even though they have overlapping niches. <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hjHxMtOCq-o/hqdefault.jpg">

***$ What is the fundamental niche?***
> Original niche for a specie

***$ What is the realized niche?***
> Niche occupied by a specie in case of competition with a stronger specie.

### Exploitation: (+,-)

- True predation. Ex: lion, gazelle
- Herbivory. Ex: giraffe, leaves
- Parasitism. Ex: fish, parasite

### Mutualism: (+,+), Symbiosis

When an association becomes very close, typically at least one species requires the other for survival.

### Commensalism: (+,0)

When one party benefits and it doesn't affect the other. Bird & nest.

### Ammensalism (-,0)

## Keystone Species

***$ What is a keystone species?***
> A species that has a disproportionate effect on community: predator, mutualist, ecosystem engineer. If a keystone species declines, its decline can have a negative effect on the entire community.

## Food chain

Feeding relationship

***$ What is a food web?***
> Multiple food chains
