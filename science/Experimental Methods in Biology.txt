What is standard error?;standard error = standard deviation/sqrt(# of samples) ;Experimental_Methods_in_Biology
Is the x-axis an independent variable (in line graphs)?;No, the x-axis is a control variable, time. ;Experimental_Methods_in_Biology
What is R^2 (scatter plot)?;The R^2 value denotes how much of the variance in your dependent variable is explained by your independent variable. An R^2 value of 1 means 100% of the variance is explained. A high R^2 value indicates a high likelhood that two variables are correlated. ;Experimental_Methods_in_Biology
