# Experimental Methods in Biology (Biostatistics)

Using statistics in biology (data analysis):
Mean, median, mode, standard deviation, standard error of mean, error bars

## Standard Deviation

Data within one standard of the mean represents ~68% of your dataset. Two standard deviations is 97% within your data

## Standard Error

***$ What is standard error?***
> standard error = standard deviation/sqrt(# of samples)

How close your mean is to the actual mean.

## Error bars

If the error bars overlap, that means that we are not confident enough that the values are different to onsider "statistically significant".

## Types of graphs

### Histogram

Distribution of data

      x-axis


### Line

Measurement over time.

The x-axis is always time

**Time is constant, not an independent variable in a line graph**

***$ Is the x-axis an independent variable (in line graphs)?***
> No, the x-axis is a control variable, time.

### Pie

Data is in percentages, out of 100%

### Bar

Comparing averages

x-axis is non-numerical

### Scatter

R^2

***$ What is R^2 (scatter plot)?***
> The R^2 value denotes how much of the variance in your dependent variable is explained by your independent variable. An R^2 value of 1 means 100% of the variance is explained. A high R^2 value indicates a high likelhood that two variables are correlated.

#### Description
- Show relationship
- Reuslt
- Statistical analysis

Examples:

**Figure 4.** Relationship between female stickleback standard length in millimeters and the number of eggs per clutch. The length of a female stickleback correlates well with total number of eggs she will product.
