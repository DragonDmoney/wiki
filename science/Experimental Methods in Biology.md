# Experimental Methods in Biology

Using statistics in biology (data analysis):
Mean, median, mode, standard deviation, standard error of mean, error bars

## Standard Deviation

Data within one standard of the mean represents ~68% of your dataset. Two standard deviations is 97% within your data

## Standard Error

***$ What is standard error?***
> standard error = standard deviation/sqrt(# of samples)

How close your mean is to the actual mean.

## Error bars

If the error bars overlap, that means that we are not confident enough that the values are different to onsider "statistically significant".
