# Chi-Square Test

Used to compaer **observed** data with **expected** data

Tests **null hypothesis** -- which states that there is no significant difference between the observed and the expected data.

x^2=\Sigma\frac{(O-E)^2}{E}

O -> Observed (given)
E -> Expected (calculate)

## 100 Coin Flips

Expected -> head(50), tails(50)

Null hypothesis: Equal probability getting heads/tails, any diff is due to chance.

***$ What is a degree of freedom?***
> Degree of freedom is number of possible outcomes - 1. For example, a dice roll would have 5 degrees of freedom.

|       | O  | E  | (O-E) | (O-E)^2 | (O-E)^2/E  |
|-------|----|----|-------|---------|------------|
| Head  | 43 | 50 | -7    | 49      | 49/50=0.98 |
| Tails | 57 | 50 | 7     | 49      | 49/50=0.98 |
