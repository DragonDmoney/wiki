# Population Ecology

***$ What is a population?***
> A group of individuals of a single species living in same general read

***$ What is population density?***
> \(density = \frac{# individuals}{area}\)

## Patterns of Dispersal

How populations are spaced out

***$ What is random dispersal?***
> Unpredicatable spacing, not as commin in nature

***$ What is uniform dispersal?***
> Usually antagonistic interactions, all organisms are equadistant

***$ What is clumped dispersal?***
> Organisms are clumped together, with large amounts of space between clumps

## Survivorship Curves

***$ What are survivorship curves?***
> A graph that indicates the proportion of offspring born to those that actually survive. <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Survivorship_Curves.jpg/600px-Survivorship_Curves.jpg">

## K and r selected species

### K selected species

***$ What are k selected species?***
> The are large in size. Sexual maturity is later in life. Produce few, large, immature offspring. Offspring receive lots of perantal care. Intraspecific competition is high. <img src="https://files.worldwildlife.org/wwfcmsprod/images/Humpback_Whale_and_Calf_WW2131047/story_full_width/8q90217t58_Humpback_Whale_and_Calf_WW2131047.jpg">

### r selected species

***$ What are r selected species?***
> The opposite of k selection. Organisms are small in size. Early sexual maturity. Produce large numbers of small mature offspring. Little parental care. Intraspecific competition is low.

## Population Growth

***$ What types of population growth is there?***
> Exponential and logistical growth

### Exponential Growth

***$ What conditions create exponential growth?***
> Unlimited resources. No predators. No competition

***$ What is the formula for exponential population growth?***
> \(\frac{dN}{dT}=B-D=r_max N\), Change in number over change in time = Births - deaths = Per capita rate of increase x number of individuals.<br>Represents unrestrained growth, does not account for carrying capacity. <img src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-images/7edbd1ab380efb207cf72aa25850838ef6c05824.png">

### Logistical Growth

***$ What is carrying capacity?***
> The max number of individuals and environment can support

***$ What is the formula for logistic growth?***
> \(\frac{dN}{dT}=r_max(\frac{K-N}{K})\). Change in number over change in time = per capita rate of increase * the unused portion of carrying capacity.

### Limiting factors

***$ What are limiting factors?***
> Constraints that prevent a population from reaching maximum growth. Limited space, food, etc

#### Density-Dependent factors:

**Population matters**

***$ What are density-dependent factors?***
> Any biotic limiting factors. Competition, diseases.

#### Density-Independent factors:

**Population does not matter**

***$ What are density-independent factors?***
> Any abiotic limiting factors. Natural disasters, hurricanes, flood.
