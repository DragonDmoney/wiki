What are interspecific interactions?;Interspecific between two different species ;Community_Ecology
What are intraspecific interactions?;Interactions within the same species. ;Community_Ecology
What is a niche?;Ecological address of a specie. What you eat, habitat, what are your competitors, etc. ;Community_Ecology
What is the competitive exclusion principle?;Two species cannot coexist if they compete for the same resource, the one that competes best will overtake the other species. ;Community_Ecology
What is the resource partition principle?;When species co-exist even though they have overlapping niches. <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hjHxMtOCq-o/hqdefault.jpg"> ;Community_Ecology
What is the fundamental niche?;Original niche for a specie ;Community_Ecology
What is the realized niche?;Niche occupied by a specie in case of competition with a stronger specie. ;Community_Ecology
What is a keystone species?;A species that has a disproportionate effect on community: predator, mutualist, ecosystem engineer. If a keystone species declines, its decline can have a negative effect on the entire community. ;Community_Ecology
