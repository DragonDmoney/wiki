How is a hypothesis shaped?;A hypothesis is shaped through exploration and discovery - such as reading scientific literature and making observations. Hypotheses are also shaped through interactions with the scientific community and larger society. ;MQB_1

How is a hypothesis tested?;Scientists test hypotheses with controlled experiments ;MQB_1

Is the process of science a prescribed linear path?;While forming and testing hypotheses is central to the process, exploration and discovery, plus interactions with the scientific community and society lead to a multitude of pathways through our described model. ;MQB_1

What is inductive reasoning?;Inductive reasoning is the process of drawing conclusions going from the specific to the general. Often contrasted with deductive reasoning ;MQB_1

What is deductive reasoning?;Deductive reasoning is a logical approach where you progress from general ideas to specific conclusions. Often contrasted with inductive reasoning ;MQB_1
What makes a question testable?;It must have testable (quantifiable) values. Height, weight, length, etc. It should always have an independent variable ;The_Scientific_Method

What is an independent variable?;Something that I am going to change (manipulated) ;The_Scientific_Method

What is a dependent variable?;Something that I am going to measure ;The_Scientific_Method

What are constant variables?;Other variables that must be identified and controlled ;The_Scientific_Method

What is a null hypothesis?;The difference that is seen between the two variables is by chance/there is no stairididal difference between the two variables (no relationship) There is no relationship between the amount of fertilizer and length of plants. ;The_Scientific_Method

What is an alternate hypothesis;This shows that there is a relationship between the variables and there is a reason behind the difference. Prediction -> if, then, because If more fertilizer is added, then the height of the plant will increase, because fertilizer has more nutrients ;The_Scientific_Method

What is a control group?;A tested group not affected by the independent variable, used for comparison ;The_Scientific_Method

What is a negative control group?;No change ;The_Scientific_Method

What is an experimental/positive control group?;The group that uses the independent variable to test on. ;The_Scientific_Method

What is quantitative data?;numeral results, measurable, can perform statistical analysis ;The_Scientific_Method

What is qualitative data?;non-numerical results, results can be subjective, cannot statistically analyze. ;The_Scientific_Method
What is standard error?;standard error = standard deviation/sqrt(# of samples) ;Experimental_Methods_in_Biology
