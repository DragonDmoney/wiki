What is a population?;A group of individuals of a single species living in same general read ;Population_Ecology
What is population density?;\(density = \frac{# individuals}{area}\) ;Population_Ecology
What is random dispersal?;Unpredicatable spacing, not as commin in nature ;Population_Ecology
What is uniform dispersal?;Usually antagonistic interactions, all organisms are equadistant ;Population_Ecology
What is clumped dispersal?;Organisms are clumped together, with large amounts of space between clumps ;Population_Ecology
What are survivorship curves?;A graph that indicates the proportion of offspring born to those that actually survive. <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Survivorship_Curves.jpg/600px-Survivorship_Curves.jpg"> ;Population_Ecology
What are k selected species?;The are large in size. Sexual maturity is later in life. Produce few, large, immature offspring. Offspring receive lots of perantal care. Intraspecific competition is high. <img src="https://files.worldwildlife.org/wwfcmsprod/images/Humpback_Whale_and_Calf_WW2131047/story_full_width/8q90217t58_Humpback_Whale_and_Calf_WW2131047.jpg"> ;Population_Ecology
What are r selected species?;The opposite of k selection. Organisms are small in size. Early sexual maturity. Produce large numbers of small mature offspring. Little parental care. Intraspecific competition is low. ;Population_Ecology
What types of population growth is there?;Exponential and logistical growth ;Population_Ecology
What conditions create exponential growth?;Unlimited resources. No predators. No competition ;Population_Ecology
What is the formula for exponential population growth?;\(\frac{dN}{dT}=B-D=r_max N\), Change in number over change in time = Births - deaths = Per capita rate of increase x number of individuals.<br>Represents unrestrained growth, does not account for carrying capacity. <img src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-images/7edbd1ab380efb207cf72aa25850838ef6c05824.png"> ;Population_Ecology
What is carrying capacity?;The max number of individuals and environment can support ;Population_Ecology
What is the formula for logistic growth?;\(\frac{dN}{dT}=r_max(\frac{K-N}{K})\). Change in number over change in time = per capita rate of increase * the unused portion of carrying capacity. ;Population_Ecology
What are limiting factors?;Constraints that prevent a population from reaching maximum growth. Limited space, food, etc ;Population_Ecology
What are density-dependent factors?;Any biotic limiting factors. Competition, diseases. ;Population_Ecology
What are density-independent factors?;Any abiotic limiting factors. Natural disasters, hurricanes, flood. ;Population_Ecology
