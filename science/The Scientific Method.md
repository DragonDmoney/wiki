# The Scientific Method

## Good Scientific Questions:
- lead to further discussion.
- lead to further investigation
- include measurable values
- lead to fact finding
- identify the independent and dependent variables.

***$ What makes a question testable?***
> It must have testable (quantifiable) values. Height, weight, length, etc.
> It should always have an independent variable

***$ What is an independent variable?***
> Something that I am going to change (manipulated)

***$ What is a dependent variable?***
> Something that I am going to measure

***$ What are constant variables?***
> Other variables that must be identified and controlled

## Null (H0) and Alternate (H1) Hypothesis

Since the H0 and H1 hypothesises are contradictory, only **one** can be supported by data

***$ What is a null hypothesis?***
> The difference that is seen between the two variables is by chance/there is no stairididal difference between the two variables (no relationship)
> There is no relationship between the amount of fertilizer and length of plants.

***$ What is an alternate hypothesis***
> This shows that there is a relationship between the variables and there is a reason behind the difference.
> Prediction -> if, then, because
> If more fertilizer is added, then the height of the plant will increase, because fertilizer has more nutrients

**Must support one of the hypothesises by the end of the experiment**

If alternate hypothesis mispredicts the relationship, it is only **partially supported**

## Example Controlled Experiment

***$ What is a control group?***
> A tested group not affected by the independent variable, used for comparison

***$ What is a negative control group?***
> No change

***$ What is an experimental/positive control group?***
> The group that uses the independent variable to test on.
