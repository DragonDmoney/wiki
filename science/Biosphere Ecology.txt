What is an energy pyramid?;Transfer of energyy from one trophic level to another ;Biosphere_Ecology
What is the 10% law (energy pyramid)?;Only 10% of energy is passed on to the next level. ;Biosphere_Ecology
What are decomposers?;Decompsers are things that get energy from all tropic levels, break down organic matter. ;Biosphere_Ecology
What is biomass?;The total mass of all the organisms in a tropic level ;Biosphere_Ecology
What are the elements of life?;Carbon (all life forms), nitrogen (proteins, nucleic acid), phosphorous (nucleic acid). ;Biosphere_Ecology
What are biogeochemical cycles?;Movements of elements of life have biotic components, geographical components, and chemical components. ;Biosphere_Ecology
What is eutrophication?;Excess nutrients like phosphorus and nitrogen leads to exponential aquatic plant growth. This depletes dissolved oxygen and prevents sunlight from reahing other plants. As plants and animals die, more oxygen is used up. This creates dead zones. ;Biosphere_Ecology
