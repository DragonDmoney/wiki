# Purple Hibiscus

Written by Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie

Page 2: narrator mentions "things fall apart" after certain day where Jaja doesn't go to communion

> Things fall apart is a famous novel about collonialism to Nigeria

**Papa -> God**

Page 3-4: Papa (the narrator's father) is praised in church for all his good deeds and things he has done.

> This may contribute to Kimibili's associated of her father and God.

There is a really big contradiction where Papa is almost "stoic" when receiving praise during church, but also throws his missal at Jaja out of extreme anger when Jaja tells he hasn't gone to communion, and doesn't plan to. Strange way to act

> ". Then I would hold the cup with both hands and raise it to my lips. One sip. The tea was always too hot, always burned my tongue, and if lunch was something peppery, my raw tongue suffered. But it didn’t matter, because I knew that when the tea burned my tongue, it burned Papa’s love into me."

Wow, this is a pretty messed up way to view love.

Page 10-11: it's pretty obvious hibiscus is going to be a reaccuring theme throughout the novel

> I meant to say I am sorry Papa broke your figurines, but the words that came out were, “I’m sorry your figurines broke, Mama.”

Papa can't do any wrong, nothing is his fault.

Page 13: Jaja is clearly revolting/standing up to his father.

Page 14: the stress placed on the whole family is starting to make Kimbili and the father unwell; symbolism or foreshadowing for something bad about to happen

> “Will you replace the figurines?” I asked. I could smell the chalky deodorant under her arms. Her brown face, flawless but for the recent jagged scar on her forehead, was expressionless. “Kpa,” she said. “I will not replace them.”

**Speaking with our spirits**

> I stared. She was sitting on my bed, knees close together. “You’re going to have a baby?” “Yes.” She smiled, still running her hand over my skirt. “When?” “In October. I went to Park Lane yesterday to see my doctor.” “Thanks be to God.” It was what Jaja and I said, what Papa expected us to say, when good things happened.

Does not appear to be much excitement for the new baby.

The whole idea of "speaking with spirits" it shown when Jaja talks with Kimbili, and they say a lot more with their eyes than their words.

The overprotective/managing nature of the father is shown by the ridiciulous schedules he places the kids on, and Jaja wonders "I wonder how old the new baby will be when he gets placed on a schedule" - the father's tyranny extends to a controlling nature of their whole lives.

The Standard runs stories about freedom and the downside of a controlling government - sound ironic??

Kambili is given anoather "love sip"

**Chapter 4**

The whole scene about the miscarriage part was just so unexpected. Why would you go through all the effort of making your wife pregnant just to beat her up and cause a miscarriage. What??

Also important to note that Kimbili and Jaja don't even mention this miscarriage incident, and instead talk about completely unrelated things. Shows the level of fear that their father has instilled into them.

I wonder what the "GOD IS LOVE" t-shirt is a metaphor for?

She feels terrible that she didn't come in first this semester (i.e. couldn't complete his unrealistic expectations).

Goes to school and talks to her in front of all her classmates. Her classmates kind of think she is crazy. She loses the ability to talk and start the pledge when she was called on (shows she cannot speak for herself or have her own identity).

She continues to see Mama's blood when she reads, shows that scene significantly traumatized her.

**Chapter 5**

Kambili clings to moments of praise her parents give her without remembering her while avoiding memories of him beating her or being a bad person.

It's strange that they have such a big house in a place they very rarely go. A show of power/strength to their previous village?

Papa gives out money for seemingly no benefit. Perhaps he actually is generous?

There is a huge wealth divide in Abba

The difference between his children and Papa's the Standard is funny, ade coker points it out.

The umunna always supports Papa's decision, shows taht they just want his power/money/aid.

His catholic dogma allows him to let his father live in extremey poverty.

Aunty ifeoma is presented as the opposite of their father, perhaps she will have a bigger role. She helps her father when she has nothing, contrasting to Papa who doesn't help his father when he is extremely rich.
