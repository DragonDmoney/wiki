# The Gangster We Are All Looking For

## Background

Written by a vietnamese author Lê Thị Diễm Thúy

## Annotations

#### Page 3

> *Ba and I were connected to the four uncles, not by blood but by water*

- Observation: Typically familial bonding only happens in a very traumatic experience. I.e: blood bonding. Interesting to put it this way (metaphor)

#### Page 6

> *Above the palm trees were large block letters that looked like they were on fire: SUNNY SAN DIEGO*

- Reaction: Welcome to america! Haha (funny)

---

> *I looked through the triangle formed by the woman's tanned knee, calf and thigh and saw the calm, sleeping waves of the ocean. My mother was out there somwehere. My father had said so*

- Observation: Sets the scene, big part of the plot will be looking for "Ma" (prediction)

#### Page 7

> *One of my uncles took a deep breath and lay down on the bed. He was still wearing his shoes and let his feet hang off the edge of the bed so he wouldn't get the covers dirty (7)*.

- Shows that the vietnamese have respect and courtesy, and that she views her "uncles" as family.


#### Page 8

> *I wrapped my arms around my knees and studied my bare feet. They were very clean; not a speck of sand or salt on them. (8)*

- Although a subtle detail, it shows she's used to having dirty feet, otherwise she wouldn't have pointed it out.


#### Page 10


- Shows the difference in culture, the vietnamese men do not understand why having extremely clean things makes sense. Based on this and the previous annotation, vietnamese are not used to clean things.

#### Page 12

> *Perhaps she sensed we'd once had a woman in our lives (12)*

- Once again, Ma is brought up, sensing this will become a common subject.

#### Page 13

> *In this photograph, my Ba and I hold hands and lean against the blue car..., waiting for the flash that lets us know something has happened... something that makes it remember us, remember ou faces, remember our clothes, remember the blurrred shape of our hands captured in that second when we shivered, waiting. (13)*

- Nothing in particular, but I just really like this quote

#### Page 20

> *Ever since my brother left, I've had a hard time taking naps. (20)*

- Shows that a vital piece of her comfort & support structure is gone with no replacement. Indicates that she heavily relied on her brother


#### Page 21

> *I began to play with the ceiling, a game that I used to play with the sky when I was lying in the fishing boat on the sea. At that time, I thought that everyone and every-thing I missed was hovering behind the sky. (21)*

- Demonstrates that she still has hope (albeit little), that all she has lost may return.


#### Page 24-25

As the butterfly is trapped inside of its glass confinement, there is something trapped inside of her (this will become symbol)


#### Page 28

> *When I went into Mel's office, I would open the glass doors of the cabinet and leave them open so the animals could get some air (28)*

- Shows that she needs someone to take care of. 


#### Page 29

> *I told the glass animals about... (29)*

- She has no friends :(

#### Page 31

> *One Friday afternoon in December, a week before Christmas vacation, I tried to free the butterfly. The result was Mel told Ba, the four uncles and me to pack our things and get out. (31)*

- :(

#### Page 32

> *I spun myself dizzy trying to remember what Ma's face looked like in my dream (32)*

- It's interesting that someone can have such an impact and take up so much mind-share of another person, but they can't even fully remember their face

#### Page 34

> *There, very faintly, was the sound. It was like a light, almost transparent, curtain rippling across a window (34)*

- Again, this hallucination, or internal struggle appears again.

#### Page 41

> *Years ago, that house, like many on the block, had begun as something pretty, with yellow curtains in the windows and flowering bushes out front.  Had they been roses? It was so long ago. Now the house was nothing more than a shell. (41)*

- Highlights a core idea that all things good come to an end. Setsunai


#### Page 45

> *That summer, with my parents asleep in the bed next to mine, my father lying on his back, his breathing like a whistle, my mother lying on her side, one arm thrown across his chest and her long hair fanning out behind her, I'd lie awake and think about thinks. (45)*

- Haha relatable

#### Page 48

> *And she would draw out the words 'long time ago' so that they sounded like three stones, one following another, down into a well. (48)*

- I can't really put my finger on it, but there seems to be a sort of faded and depressing tone the author uses. Talking about great things that happened 'a long time ago', further reinforces these vibe of setsunai.

#### Page 50

> *The youngest kids had a hard time dying. We had to explain to them that **when they were out: they couldn't just open their eyes and keep on fighting** (50)*

- Interesting...

#### Page 51

> *Though my parents didn't want me playing near the swimming pool (51)*

- It's ironic that she got to the U.S on a huge boat trip, but her parents don't want her to go near the swimming pool.

#### Page 52

Describes how the everyone had so much fun in the pool, and right after it was destroyed by the landlord. Setsunai

#### Page 57-58

The description of the couple that previously owns the house is interesting.

#### Page 67

> *When Ma first arrived in Amewrica, she had very long hair. It didn't flow to her feet but it was thick and straight and black and you could grab it by the fistful and hold it to your face. After she cut it that summer, she looked more like the women who read the news on TV. (67)*

- Setsunai


#### Page 69

> *That summer, he'd stand in the doorway of our apartent and stare at the concrete courtyard. 'It may be time to move,' he'd say. Shaking his head he'd tell my mother and me taht when they drained the pool, they should have filled it with soil (69)*

#### Page 71

> *While I slept, the sky would be dark as the back of a woman's long head of hair and all the stars would be the small white flowers she was wearing in it. (71)*

- Epic description

#### Page 73

The passage about the bum is interesting. Nothing to do and nowhere to go.

#### Page 79

> *Her father chased her out of the house, beating her with the same broom she had used every day of here life, from the time she could stand up and sweep until that very morning that she was chased away. (79)*

- Setsunai

#### Page 85 & 86

She mentions how happy the metal tube outside the playground was, with kids playing, secrets telling. Then cuts to it being the arm of a dying giant, and relating that to a napalm bombing. **setsunai**

#### Page 92

> *I see his hands punch hands punch hands punch blood*

---

> *She sends them out like birds gliding through the sky with nowhere in particular to go. Until they crash.*

- Interesting writing idea

#### Page 93

> *When I grow up I am going to be the gangster we are all looking for*

#### Page 104

Talks about good memories of her father "my young father lifting me in his arms", and then cuts to "I am on my feet again, watching my father leave"

#### Page 114

> *As evening approached, they talked about heat as some-thing that was in the past, as well as certain fruits*

---

> *Like a blind man circling a small room, searching for but always missing the door that led to the hallway, the streets, the open air*

- Awesome similee

#### Page 128

> *He had planted the desert rose three years before and was happy to see it was now beginning to bud... He picked dead leaves from the jasmine plants*

- Another examples of setsunai

#### Page 135

It's simple but deep meaning descriptions like the star game with her grandpa that are interesting.

#### Page 142

> *What my brother found funnier than anything else was when one of the women said...*

- She still treats her brother as something living.
