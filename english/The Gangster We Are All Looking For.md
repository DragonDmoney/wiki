# The Gangster We Are All Looking For

## Background

Written by a vietnamese author Lê Thị Diễm Thúy

## Annotations

> *Ba and I were connected to the four uncles, not by blood but by water (3)*

Typically familial bonding only happens in a very traumatic experience. I.e: blood bonding. Interesting to put it this way (metaphor)


> *Above the palm trees were large block letters that looked like they were on fire: SUNNY SAN DIEGO (6)*

Welcome to america! Haha (funny)


> *I looked through the triangle formed by the woman's tanned knee, calf and thigh and saw the calm, sleeping waves of the ocean. My mother was out there somwehere. My father had said so (6)*

Sets the scene, big part of the plot will be looking for "Ma" (prediction)


> *One of my uncles took a deep breath and lay down on the bed. He was still wearing his shoes and let his feet hang off the edge of the bed so he wouldn't get the covers dirty (7)*.

Shows that the vietnamese have respect and courtesy, and that she views her "uncles" as family.


> *I wrapped my arms around my knees and studied my bare feet. They were very clean; not a speck of sand or salt on them. (8)*

Although a subtle detail, it shows she's used to having dirty feet, otherwise she wouldn't have pointed it out.


**Page 10**: shows the difference in culture, the vietnamese men do not understand why having extremely clean things makes sense. Based on this and the previous annotation, vietnamese are not used to clean things.


> *Perhaps she sensed we'd once had a woman in our lives (12)*

Once again, Ma is brought up, sensing this will become a common subject.
