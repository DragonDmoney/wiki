# Congruence

Geometric figures are congruent if they are the same size, dimension, and type. **Corresponding angles** and **corresponding sides** are in the same position in polygons with an equal number of sides

Two polygons are **congruent polygons** if and only if their corresponding sides are congruent. Thus triangles that are the same size and shape are congruent.

When you write a congruence statement for two polygons **always** list the corresponding vetcies in the same order.
