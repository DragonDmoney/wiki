How does an example Anki card work?;You can indicate an italic text by prefixing it with $. And this text is also included :) ;index

What is this?;This is another test anki card ;index
What is a degree of freedom?;Degree of freedom is number of possible outcomes - 1. For example, a dice roll would have 5 degrees of freedom. ;Chi_Square
What makes a question testable?;It must have testable (quantifiable) values. Height, weight, length, etc. It should always have an independent variable ;The_Scientific_Method

What is an independent variable?;Something that I am going to change (manipulated) ;The_Scientific_Method

What is a dependent variable?;Something that I am going to measure ;The_Scientific_Method

What are constant variables?;Other variables that must be identified and controlled ;The_Scientific_Method

What is a null hypothesis?;The difference that is seen between the two variables is by chance/there is no stairididal difference between the two variables (no relationship) There is no relationship between the amount of fertilizer and length of plants. ;The_Scientific_Method

What is an alternate hypothesis;This shows that there is a relationship between the variables and there is a reason behind the difference. Prediction -> if, then, because If more fertilizer is added, then the height of the plant will increase, because fertilizer has more nutrients ;The_Scientific_Method

What is a control group?;A tested group not affected by the independent variable, used for comparison ;The_Scientific_Method

What is a negative control group?;No change ;The_Scientific_Method

What is an experimental/positive control group?;The group that uses the independent variable to test on. ;The_Scientific_Method

What is quantitative data?;numeral results, measurable, can perform statistical analysis ;The_Scientific_Method

What is qualitative data?;non-numerical results, results can be subjective, cannot statistically analyze. ;The_Scientific_Method
What is standard error?;standard error = standard deviation/sqrt(# of samples) ;Experimental_Methods_in_Biology

Is the x-axis an independent variable (in line graphs)?;No, the x-axis is a control variable, time. ;Experimental_Methods_in_Biology

What is R^2 (scatter plot)?;The R^2 value denotes how much of the variance in your dependent variable is explained by your independent variable. An R^2 value of 1 means 100% of the variance is explained. A high R^2 value indicates a high likelhood that two variables are correlated. ;Experimental_Methods_in_Biology
How is a hypothesis shaped?;A hypothesis is shaped through exploration and discovery - such as reading scientific literature and making observations. Hypotheses are also shaped through interactions with the scientific community and larger society. ;MQB_1

How is a hypothesis tested?;Scientists test hypotheses with controlled experiments ;MQB_1

Is the process of science a prescribed linear path?;While forming and testing hypotheses is central to the process, exploration and discovery, plus interactions with the scientific community and society lead to a multitude of pathways through our described model. ;MQB_1

What is inductive reasoning?;Inductive reasoning is the process of drawing conclusions going from the specific to the general. Often contrasted with deductive reasoning ;MQB_1

What is deductive reasoning?;Deductive reasoning is a logical approach where you progress from general ideas to specific conclusions. Often contrasted with inductive reasoning ;MQB_1
What is ecology?;Ecology is the study of interactions ;Ecology

What is biotic/abiotic?;Biotic describes living things, abiotic is non-living things. ;Ecology

How do yo know if two organisms are of the same specie?;They can reproduce with each other, interbreed, produce fertile offspring ;Ecology

What are individual interactions?;Survival and reproduction, the unit of natural selection ;Ecology

What are population interactions?;Population dynamics, the unit of evolution ;Ecology

What are community interactions?;Interactions among species ;Ecology

What are ecosystem interactions?;Flow of energy and matter ;Ecology

What are biosphere interactions?;Global processes ;Ecology
What is a population?;A group of individuals of a single species living in same general read ;Population_Ecology

What is population density?;\(density = \frac{# individuals}{area}\) ;Population_Ecology

What is random dispersal?;Unpredicatable spacing, not as commin in nature ;Population_Ecology

What is uniform dispersal?;Usually antagonistic interactions, all organisms are equadistant ;Population_Ecology

What is clumped dispersal?;Organisms are clumped together, with large amounts of space between clumps ;Population_Ecology

What are survivorship curves?;A graph that indicates the proportion of offspring born to those that actually survive. <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Survivorship_Curves.jpg/600px-Survivorship_Curves.jpg"> ;Population_Ecology

What are k selected species?;The are large in size. Sexual maturity is later in life. Produce few, large, immature offspring. Offspring receive lots of perantal care. Intraspecific competition is high. <img src="https://files.worldwildlife.org/wwfcmsprod/images/Humpback_Whale_and_Calf_WW2131047/story_full_width/8q90217t58_Humpback_Whale_and_Calf_WW2131047.jpg"> ;Population_Ecology

What are r selected species?;The opposite of k selection. Organisms are small in size. Early sexual maturity. Produce large numbers of small mature offspring. Little parental care. Intraspecific competition is low. ;Population_Ecology

What types of population growth is there?;Exponential and logistical growth ;Population_Ecology

What conditions create exponential growth?;Unlimited resources. No predators. No competition ;Population_Ecology

What is the formula for exponential population growth?;\(\frac{dN}{dT}=B-D=r_max N\), Change in number over change in time = Births - deaths = Per capita rate of increase x number of individuals.<br>Represents unrestrained growth, does not account for carrying capacity. <img src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-images/7edbd1ab380efb207cf72aa25850838ef6c05824.png"> ;Population_Ecology

What is carrying capacity?;The max number of individuals and environment can support ;Population_Ecology

What is the formula for logistic growth?;\(\frac{dN}{dT}=r_max(\frac{K-N}{K})\). Change in number over change in time = per capita rate of increase * the unused portion of carrying capacity. ;Population_Ecology

What are limiting factors?;Constraints that prevent a population from reaching maximum growth. Limited space, food, etc ;Population_Ecology

What are density-dependent factors?;Any biotic limiting factors. Competition, diseases. ;Population_Ecology

What are density-independent factors?;Any abiotic limiting factors. Natural disasters, hurricanes, flood. ;Population_Ecology
